## Welcome to Spring

As the days grow longer and nature awakens, it's the perfect time to refresh your personal style and living spaces. This season, we're embracing a palette of soft neutrals, warm terracottas, and unexpected pops of sage green.

## The Spring Palette

Our spring collection centers around colors that transition effortlessly from winter to summer:

- **Cream & Ivory** - Timeless and versatile
- **Terracotta** - Warm and grounding
- **Sage Green** - Fresh and natural
- **Soft Blue** - Calm and serene
- **Natural Linen** - Textured and organic

## Styling Tips

### For Your Wardrobe

**Layer Thoughtfully**
Spring weather is unpredictable. Build outfits that can adapt:

1. Start with a breathable base layer
2. Add a light knit or cardigan
3. Top with a versatile jacket
4. Accessorize with a quality tote or bag

**Mix Textures**
Combine smooth cottons with textured linens, sleek leather with soft knits. The interplay of textures adds depth to simple outfits.

### For Your Home

**Lighten Your Space**
- Swap heavy throws for lighter weaves
- Replace dark cushions with neutral tones
- Add fresh greenery and botanicals
- Open curtains to maximize natural light

**Create Vignettes**
Group items in odd numbers (3 or 5) for visual interest. Mix heights, textures, and shapes for a curated look that feels collected, not contrived.

## Our Spring Picks

### The Everyday Tote

Our Premium Canvas Tote transitions beautifully into spring. The natural canvas and leather accents complement the season's earthy palette perfectly.

**Style it with:**
- A cream linen shirt
- High-waisted denim
- Simple gold jewelry
- White sneakers or leather sandals

### The Lightweight Throw

As evenings still carry a chill, the Merino Wool Throw in oatmeal adds warmth without weight. Drape it over your sofa or take it outdoors for evening gatherings.

## The Philosophy of Seasonal Dressing

Spring isn't about buying new everything—it's about reimagining what you have. Our pieces are designed to work together and with items you already own. Quality over quantity, always.

## Ready to Refresh?
