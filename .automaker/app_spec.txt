  <project_name>Retail Boutique Website Template</project_name>

  <overview>
    A premium, editorial-styled website template designed for retail businesses including clothing boutiques, gift shops, home goods stores, plant shops, bookstores, jewelry stores, vintage/antique shops, specialty food stores, and hobby shops. The template embodies a carefully curated aesthetic that feels like a lookbook or magazine spread, emphasizing products and the lifestyle/taste the shop represents. Built on Astro with static generation for optimal performance, the template features an aspirational but approachable tone, strong visual identity through typography and whitespace, and a gallery-like product presentation. The architecture supports external e-commerce integration (Shopify, Square, Etsy, Big Cartel) without native checkout functionality, focusing on being a beautiful showcase that drives customers to purchase platforms. The template prioritizes Lighthouse 95+ performance, local business SEO, comprehensive accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and third-party integration capabilities for email marketing, social feeds, and contact forms.

      <name>Remove web design business branding and content</name>
      <description>This whole repo was forked. The original repo had a different purpose - it was for a web design small business. There is still a lot of leftover content present (especially text and site sections) that have to do with a web design business. This doesn&apos;t match the purpose of this repo - to serve as a starter template for me to build sites for small retail businesses.

Please identify these vestigal elements and either remove them, or update them to make them fit the real purpose of this repo, whichever is easier.

I attached a screenshot of the home page as an example - we wouldn&apos;t want that mini-website-mockup element for a restaurant site. we also wouldn&apos;t want the text &quot;Fast-loading, search-friendly websites that turn visitors into customers.&quot; - this is supposed to be an example/starter site for a retail business.</description>
