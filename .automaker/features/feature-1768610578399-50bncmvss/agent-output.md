1. **Goal**: Create the missing "Web Hosting" page that's linked from the front page.

2. **Approach**: First, I'll explore the codebase to understand the existing page structure and find the link to the Web Hosting page. Then I'll create a new page following the existing patterns and conventions used in other pages.

3. **Files to Touch**:
   - New file for the Web Hosting page (location TBD after exploration)
   - Possibly routing configuration if needed

4. **Tasks**:
   1. Find the front page and locate the Web Hosting link
   2. Understand the page structure and routing pattern
   3. Examine existing pages as templates
   4. Create the Web Hosting page following existing conventions
   5. Verify the page matches the link destination

5. **Risks**:
   - Need to match the exact route/path expected by the link
   - Should follow existing styling and component patterns

[PLAN_GENERATED] Planning outline complete.

Now let me explore the codebase:

🔧 Tool: Glob
Input: {
  "pattern": "**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}"
}

🔧 Tool: Glob
Input: {
  "pattern": "**/index.html"
}
Let me look at the source files directly, excluding node_modules:

🔧 Tool: Glob
Input: {
  "pattern": "src/**/*.{astro,tsx,jsx,ts,js}"
}

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\dist\\index.html"
}
I can see the structure. The "Web Hosting" link points to `/services/hosting`. Let me look at the source pages structure and an existing page to understand the pattern:

🔧 Tool: Glob
Input: {
  "pattern": "src/pages/**/*.astro"
}

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\pages\\services.astro"
}
Now I understand the structure. The link on the front page points to `/services/hosting`. I need to create a new page at `src/pages/services/hosting.astro`. Let me also look at the Layout component to understand the page structure better:

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\layouts\\Layout.astro"
}

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\components\\HeroSection.astro"
}
Now I have a clear understanding of the project structure. I need to create the `src/pages/services/hosting.astro` page. Let me also check if there's a services directory already:

🔧 Tool: Bash
Input: {
  "command": "ls -la \"C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\pages\\services\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Directory does not exist\"",
  "description": "Check if services directory exists"
}
The directory exists but is empty. Now let me create the Web Hosting page following the existing patterns:

🔧 Tool: Write
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\pages\\services\\hosting.astro",
  "content": "---\n/**\n * Web Hosting Service Page - Houston Web Services\n * A dedicated page showcasing web hosting services for small businesses\n * in West Houston, including features, pricing, and benefits.\n *\n * Sections:\n * 1.

Now let me verify that the FAQAccordion component exists and check its interface to make sure I'm using it correctly:

}

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\components\\ContactCTA.astro"
}
I see that the FAQAccordion component expects `items` prop with objects that have `question` and `answer` properties. Let me also check the ContactCTA interface to make sure I'm using the correct prop names:

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\types\\contact-cta.ts"
}

🔧 Tool: Read
Input: {
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src\\types\\faq.ts"
}
I see the issues - the FAQAccordion expects `items` (not `faqs`) and each item needs an `id` field. The ContactCTA expects `supportingText` (not `text`). Let me update the hosting page to fix these issues:

Now let me fix the ContactCTA component - it uses `supportingText` not `text`:

}
Let me run a quick type-check with the build to ensure the page is valid:

🔧 Tool: Bash
Input: {
  "command": "cd \"C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\" && npm run build 2>&1 | head -100",
  "description": "Build the Astro project to verify",
  "timeout": 120000
}
The build completed successfully and the hosting page was built at `/services/hosting/index.html`. The page is now accessible at `/services/hosting` which matches the link on the front page.

Let me verify the link on the front page matches:

🔧 Tool: Grep
Input: {
  "pattern": "/services/hosting",
  "path": "C:\\Users\\James\\Repos\\houston-web-services\\src",
  "output_mode": "content"
}
The link `/services/hosting` on the front page now correctly points to the new hosting page I created.
