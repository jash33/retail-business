This section should target west Houston businesses with persuasive copy and a clear call-to-action.\n\nRequirements:\n- Position the section at the bottom of the page, above the footer\n- Design a compelling headline that creates urgency or highlights value proposition\n- Include supporting text that specifically mentions serving west Houston businesses and addresses their pain points or needs\n- Add a prominent CTA button that links to the contact page\n- Ensure the section stands out visually from surrounding content (consider contrasting background color or border)\n- Make the CTA button action-oriented with specific copy (e.g., \"Get Your Free Quote\", \"Schedule a Consultation\" rather than generic \"Contact Us\")\n- Ensure the section is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices\n- Optimize for accessibility (proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels, color contrast)\n- Consider adding trust signals (testimonial count, years in business, service area badge) to increase conversions\n- Track CTA button clicks for conversion analysis\n\nDesign Considerations:\n- Use visual hierarchy to guide eyes from headline → supporting text → CTA\n- Ensure sufficient padding/whitespace around the section\n- CTA button should be large enough for easy clicking on mobile devices\n- Consider subtle animation or styling to draw attention without being intrusive",
