Problem Statement\n\nThe current retail boutique homepage has visual elements that don't align with typical retail e-commerce patterns customers expect. The page uses a tech/SaaS-style hero section with animated grid backgrounds, browser mockups, floating notification cards, and location coordinates—all inappropriate for a retail storefront. Customers visiting a boutique website expect to immediately see products, clear brand messaging, and intuitive shopping pathways, not website-building service demonstrations.\n\n## 2. User Story\n\n**As a** boutique customer visiting the homepage,  \n**I want** to see a clean, beautiful, product-focused shopping experience that follows familiar retail patterns,  \n**so that** I can quickly understand what the store offers and start shopping confidently.\n\n## 3. Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Happy Path\n- **GIVEN** a customer visits the homepage, **WHEN** the page loads, **THEN** they see a clean hero with a product lifestyle image and clear shopping CTAs\n- **GIVEN** a customer is on the homepage, **WHEN** they scroll down, **THEN** they see featured products, new arrivals, and category navigation in a logical flow\n- **GIVEN** a customer wants to explore, **WHEN** they look at the hero section, **THEN** they see prominent \"Shop Now\" and category browsing options without tech-style distractions\n\n### Edge Cases\n- **GIVEN** the site is viewed on mobile, **WHEN** the hero loads, **THEN** text remains readable and CTAs are easily tappable\n- **GIVEN** a user has reduced motion preferences, **WHEN** viewing the page, **THEN** all animations are disabled gracefully\n\n### Error Handling\n- **GIVEN** hero image fails to load, **WHEN** the page renders, **THEN** a graceful background color fallback is shown\n- **GIVEN** no featured products exist, **WHEN** viewing the homepage, **THEN** the section displays a tasteful placeholder message\n\n## 4. Technical Context\n\n| Aspect | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Affected Files | `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/components/HeroSection.astro` |\n| Dependencies | None (Astro-native) |\n| Constraints | Must maintain accessibility, responsive design, dark mode support |\n| Patterns to Follow | BEM CSS naming, CSS variables from `variables.css`, existing component structure |\n\n## 5. Non-Goals\n\n- **NOT** implementing a full e-commerce cart system\n- **NOT** changing the navigation/header component\n- **NOT** modifying product data structures or config files\n- **NOT** adding new external dependencies\n- **NOT** redesigning other pages (About, Contact, etc.)\n\n## 6. Implementation Tasks\n\n```tasks\n## Phase 1: Hero Section Cleanup\n- [ ] T001: Remove browser mockup, floating cards, and tech-style animations from hero | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n- [ ] T002: Remove animated grid background, floating orbs, and skyline decorations | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n- [ ] T003: Remove location cue with coordinates (inappropriate for retail) | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n\n## Phase 2: Hero Section Redesign\n- [ ] T004: Create clean retail hero with lifestyle image placeholder and gradient overlay | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n- [ ] T005: Simplify hero typography to headline, subheadline, and 2 CTAs max | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n- [ ] T006: Redesign trust badges as minimal inline text (free shipping, gift wrapping, local artisans) | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n- [ ] T007: Update hero CSS for clean, minimal aesthetic with subtle animations | File: src/components/HeroSection.astro\n\n## Phase 3: Homepage Content Optimization\n- [ ] T008: Update homepage hero props with retail-appropriate messaging | File: src/pages/index.astro\n- [ ] T009: Reorganize homepage sections for optimal retail flow (Hero → Products → Categories → Social Proof) | File: src/pages/index.astro\n- [ ] T010: Remove or streamline sections that add clutter (condense FAQ, simplify differentiators) | File: src/pages/index.astro\n```\n\n## 7. Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Hero load time | No complex animations, faster paint |\n| Mobile usability | Hero CTAs 44px+ tap targets |\n| Visual clarity | Hero communicates brand/product in <3 seconds |\n| Code reduction | Hero CSS reduced by ~50% from removing mockup styles |\n\n## 8. Risks & Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Removing animations may feel \"flat\" | Add subtle, tasteful CSS transitions on CTAs and hover states |\n| Hero without image placeholder looks empty | Use elegant gradient background as fallback |\n| Loss of \"unique\" visual identity | Focus uniqueness on typography, color palette, and product photography instead |\n\n---",
